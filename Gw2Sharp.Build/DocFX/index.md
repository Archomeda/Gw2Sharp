# Gw2Sharp Documentation
Gw2Sharp is an client API wrapper around the [official Guild Wars 2 API](https://api.guildwars2.com/) for .NET.
It's asynchronous and multi-platform thanks to .NET Standard.

At the moment this documention site is a work in progress.
You can already view the automatically generator docs, however there are no examples yet.
